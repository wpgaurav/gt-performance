# GT Performance validation

## Automated gates

Validated on 2026-07-18:

- WordPress Coding Standards: 58 production PHP files passed.
- PHPStan: level 6 passed with WordPress and WP-CLI stubs.
- PHPUnit: 21 tests and 39 assertions passed.
- Composer security audit: no known vulnerable packages.
- Release package: production dependencies installed, ZIP integrity passed, and no development dependencies included.

## WordPress Playground smoke run

Runtime:

- WordPress 7.0.2
- PHP 8.1.34
- Fresh disposable site
- Source mounted as `gt-performance`

Verified:

- Plugin detected, activated, and rendered its settings screen without PHP warnings or fatals.
- The Cloudflare settings screen rendered both scoped-token and legacy Global API Key modes, including account email, domain, and optional Zone ID fields.
- Selective response-cookie tests verify that Core Forms voter cookies can be removed without dropping unrelated commerce/session cookies.
- Activation created the schema, schedules, compiled config, and writable cache directories.
- Page-cache drop-in installation added an owned `advanced-cache.php` and enabled `WP_CACHE`.
- An anonymous first request returned `X-GT-Cache: MISS`.
- The next identical request returned `X-GT-Cache: HIT`, an `Age` header, an ETag, and byte-identical HTML.
- `If-None-Match` returned HTTP 304 with an empty body.
- An ignored `utm_source` query reused the canonical cache entry.
- An unknown query parameter bypassed storage and returned `Cache-Control: no-store, private`.
- Full purge removed the cached files and the next request safely returned MISS.
- A purge/request cross-worker race returned a safe MISS after the runtime fix.
- Restarting WordPress with the mounted plugin temporarily unavailable did not fatal after the drop-in guard fix.
- Deactivation removed the owned page-cache drop-in, restored the plugin-owned `WP_CACHE` change, unscheduled jobs, and left the public site responding with HTTP 200.

## External gates still requiring credentials or installed integrations

- FluentCart, Easy Digital Downloads, and WooCommerce checkout E2E tests require those plugins and test payment configurations.
- Redis installation requires PhpRedis and a disposable Redis namespace.
- Multisite and host-specific caching combinations remain pre-stable compatibility work.

## Gatilab live validation

Validated on the authenticated Gatilab WordPress installation:

- Installed and activated GT Performance `0.1.0-alpha.3`; WordPress reports the same version.
- Page-cache drop-in is owned, `WP_CACHE` is enabled, Redis is owned, and the settings and Plugins screens have no browser console errors.
- Cloudflare Global API Key mode was configured through encrypted settings using the account email and domain; zone discovery and the managed Free-plan Cache Rule synchronized successfully.
- The Gatilab homepage contains a Core Forms poll and correctly remains uncached with its voter cookie.
- A normal article changed from origin `MISS` to `HIT`. Five origin-cache HIT samples had a median TTFB of 0.233 seconds versus 0.569 seconds for cache-bypassed requests.
- After Cloudflare synchronization, five consecutive edge HIT samples had a median TTFB of 0.100 seconds and all reported `CF-Cache-Status: HIT`.
